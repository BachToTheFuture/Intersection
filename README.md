# Intersection

## Find out how you intersect with others.

Talking about your experiences with people who understand and relate to them can be therapeutic and beneficial to your mental health as it can alleviate your sense of isolation and encourage a feeling of belonging. However, it can be difficult to find people with shared identities both in the real world or on social media apps due to lack of visibility or stigma.

Intersection is a social network with the sole purpose of connecting people to identity-based forums in which they can speak freely in a safe environment, share their story, engage in discussions, come across different points of view, and meet new people with intersecting identities.
 
When you join Intersection, you'll have the opportunity to add tags that correspond to your identities and experiences. Once you add your tags, you'll be able to connect with others with similar experiences through a customized forum that displays posts that relate to your tags. If you see a post you resonate with, you can comment on the post to show your support or further the discussion. Intersection also has built-in comment suggestions that can help you start a conversation.
